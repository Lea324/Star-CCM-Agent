# Star-CCM-Agent
This project aims to transform CFD workflows in Simcenter STAR-CCM+ from a manual, click-intensive process into a streamlined, AI-assisted pipeline, enabling engineers to focus on high-level physical modelling and design decisions rather than software syntax and repetitive operations.
